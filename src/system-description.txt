# Outline the system structure (including necessary files and directories for running the code)

In assignment-1-ajithksenthil-main/src/code/assignment-1.pynb you can find the code that extracts the dates from the docx file. The input and output docx files are in assignment-1-ajithksenthil-main/src/data. The code reads from the input file in the data folder and writes to the output file in the data folder. The way I approached this was incrementally testing my regex query and using regex expressions I know I will use repeatedly as variables that I inserted into my final regex query. I was originally testing on the test data instead of the input file itself to make sure I get all the cases. Solely testing on this data gave me errors in the input file even if it worked for the test data. Then I modified it to work with the input data fixing the catastrophic backtracking error.
